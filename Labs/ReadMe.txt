You will use the Labs folder to commit all your lab files.

1. Make sure that inside the Labs folder you create the package first. For 
instance if you are working on Lab2, the package must be called lab2 (yes lower case). 

2. Inside the package lab2, you will place all your .java files for that lab. 

3. For the next lab, you will create a new package. For instance, for when you start
to work on lab3, you must create a new package in your repository inside the Labs folder
that will be called lab3, and inside lab3 you will place all your .java files that are related
to lab3. 

4. You must make sure that all the Java files that you place inside these packages must be compilable and 
runnable. 

5. To recieve full credit for the lab, make sure to call the TA, at your desk and show them that you have placed
the required Java files appropriately inside the packages. You are not asked to complete every single component
for the lab to recieve full credit. You are only asked to show us some evidence that you have worked towards
the lab, and for this we will give you full credit.
